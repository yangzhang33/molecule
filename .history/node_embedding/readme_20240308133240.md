# How to use:
* download the data MolSTM_data_version2.1 or Data_version_3 and unzip it all.
* Change the root for dataset in main.py, where raw file is.
* Run python main.py.

main.py runs the model for one batch, its inputs are(use todense): 
* x: the node attributes (b, n, fx)
* e: the edge attributes (b, n, n, fe)
* y: the global feature, empty here. (b, 0)

the outputs are: 
* aggregated_features: the vector embedding of node features, the aggregation is sum over x.
* x: the updated node attributes (b, n, fx)
* e: the updated edge attributes (b, n, n, fe)
* y: the updated global feature, empty here. (b, 0)

the input and output dimensions are the same, if we introduce extra node features, it could be different.
